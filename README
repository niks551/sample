There is one map-reduce job 'AnlyticsJob' in this implementation, it will scan the Visitor table and output the basic metric values to a SQL DB.

MetricDAO provides 3 kinds of interface to the application:
1. String getAnalyticsForCampaign(String merchantKey, String campaignKey, String rangeTag);
  analytics result of a specific campaign.
2. String getTotalAnalyticsForGroup(String merchantKey, int groupType, String rangeTag);
  total analytics result of the group (either treatment or control)
3.String getTotalAnalyticsForMerchant(String merchantKey, String rangeTag);
  total analytics of the merchant.

This package also includes some applications to upload the analytics result to google docs. Refer to 'PushAnalyticsYesterday', 'PushAnalyticsLast7', 'PushAnalyticsLast30', 'PushAnalyticsThismonth'.

To generate the assembly package, type 'mvn assembly:assembly", it will compile the package, run the unit tests, generate the analytics jar and generate the assembly package under target/ folder.

To run the analytics, copy the assembly package analytics-assembly.tar.gz to any machine that you wish to run the analytics on, unpack it, and then run 'runAnalytics.sh' which is under analytics/script/.
